# Chatroom-b-w-windows-and-ubuntu
<h2>Objective of this repository</h2>
I want to acheive a successfull communication way to communicate between my Windows and Ubuntu system thorugh terminal.
This will help me in sending links or anyother 'msg-string' from my PC1 to PC2.
Note: Both the system should in close proximity like some 10-15 mtrs.
<h3>Input for verification</h3>
Since i am new to this, i will upgrade my repo to include security concerns too.
For now, to indentify the system i will use IP address of both the PC as verification method for chat-room
<h4>Initital Commit on 24 Jan 2024</h4>
As a part of my initial commit, i have added two python code files which are listen.py and listener.py
The listen.py should be run from the Windows system whereas the otherone should be run from Ubuntu system and taking IP address of the other system as input.
Thus ensuring that it is a mututal agreement b/w both the system-users
